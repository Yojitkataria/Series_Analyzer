*Built with ❤️ using Python, Hugging Face, and Gradio*


import gradio as gr
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# 1. This is the "drawing" function
# It creates a plot using matplotlib
def create_plot(amplitude):
    # Generate some simple data
    x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
    y = amplitude * np.sin(x)
    
    # Create the plot
    fig = plt.figure()
    plt.plot(x, y, label=f'Amplitude = {amplitude}')
    plt.title("Simple Sine Wave Plot")
    plt.xlabel("X-Axis")
    plt.ylabel("Y-Axis")
    plt.legend()
    
    # Return the plot "figure"
    return fig

# 2. This is the Gradio interface
# It tells Gradio to create a web UI with:
# - An "input" slider for the 'amplitude'
# - An "output" area to display the plot
demo = gr.Interface(
    fn=create_plot,  # The function to call
    inputs=gr.Slider(minimum=1, maximum=10, value=5, label="Plot Amplitude"), # Input component
    outputs="plot",  # Output component
    title="Python 'Drawing' with Gradio Example"
)

# 3. This line would start the web server
# if you were running it on your computer
# demo.launch()
